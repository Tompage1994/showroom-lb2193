= Building out the basics for config as code.

[#setup]
== Task 1 - Setting up the project

In this lab, you will be creating configuration files in order to set a state on the Ansible Automation Platform.
This requires several prerequisites.


Install our collections and containers.podman using `ansible-galaxy` command. Make sure the versions are correct.

```console
ansible-galaxy collection install infra.ee_utilities:4.0.0 infra.aap_configuration:3.1.0 containers.podman:1.16.3 community.general:10.4.0 ansible.hub:1.0.0 ansible.platform:2.5.20250213 ansible.controller:4.6.8
```

- https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/projects.html#collections-support[Using collections in AAP]



[#variable_files]
== Task 2 - Creating Variable Files

**In the next few steps pay attention to the folder paths and make sure to put the files in the correct folders**

Set the variables to be used in the collections for use. These include hosts, usernames, and other variables that are reused in each role.

Create a file in this folder path
[source,yaml]
group_vars/all/auth.yml

With the following content:

[source,yaml]
----
sandbox_id: '###REPLACEME'

aap_hostname: "{{ 'controller.' + lookup('ansible.builtin.env', 'GUID') + '.sandbox' + sandbox_id + '.opentlc.com' }}"
aap_username: lab-user
aap_password: "{{ aap_password }}"
aap_validate_certs: false
aap_request_timeout: 60

ee_pull_collections_from_hub: false
aap_service_account_username: aap_service_account

ee_registry_username: lab-user
ee_registry_password: "{{ aap_password }}"
ee_registry_dest: "{{ aap_hostname }}/config"

ee_base_registry: "{{ aap_hostname }}"
ee_base_registry_username: "{{ aap_username }}"
ee_base_registry_password: "{{ aap_password }}"
ee_validate_certs: false
...
----


NOTE: `sandbox_id` value needs to be inside quotes or you will get an error saying: 'an only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str'

Further documentation for those who are interested to learn more see:

- https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html#organizing-host-and-group-variables[more about group_vars]



[#inventory]
== Task 3 - Creating our inventory file

Create your inventory file `inventory.yml`, You do not need to replace anything in this file.

[source,yaml]
---
all:
  children:
    automationcontroller:
      hosts:
        control:
          ansible_host: "{{ 'controller.' + lookup('ansible.builtin.env', 'GUID') + '.sandbox' + sandbox_id + '.opentlc.com' }}"
    execution:
      hosts:
        localhost:
          ansible_connection: local
...
---

NOTE: These are hostnames do not have 'https://' or things will fail

Further documentation for those who are interested to learn more see:

- https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/inventories.html#add-source[how to use this source in AAP]

[#vault]
== Task 4 - Create our Vault

Create a vault file `vault.yml` and **YOU WILL NEED TO FILL THESE IN** with the provided password for AAP for each variable. Currently they are set to the description of what you should be updating them too.

[source,yaml]
---
vault_pass: ###REPLACEME
aap_password: ###REPLACEME
aap_service_account_password: ###REPLACEME
student_account: ###REPLACEME
...


NOTE: the easiest way to do this is have all passwords be the provided password.


Create a `.password` file **We do not recommend you do this outside of lab environment** put your generated password in this file. Even though we are not committing this file into git because we have it in our ignore list, we do not recommend putting passwords in plain text ever, this is just to simplify/speed up the lab.

```text
Your_Generated_Password_In_.password_File
```

Create an `ansible.cfg` file to point to the .password file.

```ini
[defaults]
vault_password_file=.password
```

Encrypt vault with the password in the .password file

```console
ansible-vault encrypt vault.yml
```

[#organizations]
== Task 5 - Create organizations

Create a file `group_vars/all/organizations.yml`

[source,yaml]
---
aap_organizations:
  - name: config_as_code
...

[source,yaml]
---
aap_teams:

    description: config as code team
    organization: config_as_code
...

[#service_account]
== Task 7 - Create a service account

Create a file `group_vars/all/users.yml`

[source,yaml]
---
aap_user_accounts:

    password: "{{ aap_service_account_password }}"
    is_superuser: true
    state: "present"
...

[#repositories]
== Task 8 - Create Collection Repositories and Remotes

Create a file `group_vars/all/hub_repositories.yml` to create the list of community repositories and their remote counterpart.

[source,yaml]
---
hub_collection_remotes:
  - name: community-infra
    url: 'https://galaxy.ansible.com/'
    requirements:
      - name: infra.ee_utilities
        version: '>=4.0.0'

[#playbook_create]
== Task 9 - Create a playbook to apply the configuration


The next step is to create a playbook/file `playbooks/aap_config.yml` that will call the aap_configuration dispatch role which will apply all provided configurations in the order that they need to be created.

[source,yaml]
---
- name: Playbook to configure ansible controller post installation
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  vars_files:
    - ../vault.yml
  connection: local
  tasks:
    - name: Call dispatch role
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: infra.aap_configuration.dispatch
...

== Task 10 - Check your paths

Your folder structure should look like this, check the file structure to
make sure files are in the right levels. Run the `+tree+` command to
verify.

[source,yaml]
----
Fix This and input tree output
----


[#playbook_run]
== Task 11 - Put the playbook into action

The next step is to run the playbook, in order to do the initial setup of everything above on the Platform.


```console
ansible-playbook playbooks/aap_config.yml -i inventory.yml -l execution
```
While the playbook is running you can go to the Automation Hub tab and peak at the Task Management to see the repository syncing process
