== üëã Configuring the Automation controller

#### Estimated time to complete: _70 minutes_

In this section, you will only be given a summary of the objects you
need to create along with some screenshots of a controller that is
configured with the completed code. You will also be provided the
variables sections from the readme‚Äôs for each of the required roles to
help you complete this task.

The screen on the left shows the login screen. You can log in with the
following credentials and then continue on to the tasks:

* Username: `+admin+`
* Password: `+ansible123!+`

A Gitea server is also provided to use with the same password as above,
with the user account `+ansible+`. It is accessable using
`+https://gitea-8443-$INSTRUQT_PARTICIPANT_ID.env.play.instruqt.com/ansible/+`

== ‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Configure settings

Create a file `+group_vars/all/settings.yml+` and copy all this into the
file.

controller_settings:
  settings:
    GALAXY_IGNORE_CERTS: true

== ‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Configure Execution Environments

Create a file `+group_vars/all/execution_environments.yml+` and add the
required information to the list `+controller_execution_environments+`
to configure the UI to look like the screenshots Remember you can use
the `+ah_host+` variable to define the hub. Each image name should look
like `+{{ ah_host }}/image_name+`

== ‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - Create credential types

Create a file `+group_vars/all/credential_types.yml+` where we will
create a list called `+controller_credential_types+` that has 5
variables per item which are:

* `+name+` this is required and will be what the credential type will be
called
* `+description+` this is the description of the credential type
* `+kind+` The type of credential type being added. Note that only cloud
and net can be used for creating credential types.
* `+inputs+` Enter inputs using either JSON or YAML syntax. Refer to the
Ansible controller documentation for example syntax. These will be the
fields in the GUI that prompt the user for input.
* `+injectors+` Enter injectors using either JSON or YAML syntax. Refer
to the Ansible controller documentation for example syntax. These are
the variables that will then be useable in a job.

which the role will loop over and for each item in this list it will
create custom credential types for use in the controller.
