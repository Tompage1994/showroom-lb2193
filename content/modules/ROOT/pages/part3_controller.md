üëã Configuring the Automation controller
===
#### Estimated time to complete: *70 minutes*<p>

In this section, you will only be given a summary of the objects you need to create along with some screenshots of a controller that is configured with the completed code. You will also be provided the variables sections from the readme's for each of the required roles to help you complete this task.

The screen on the left shows the login screen. You can log in with the following credentials and then continue on to the tasks:

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `ansible123!`

A Gitea server is also provided to use with the same password as above, with the user account `ansible`. It is accessable using `https://gitea-8443-$INSTRUQT_PARTICIPANT_ID.env.play.instruqt.com/ansible/`

‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Configure settings
===
Create a file `group_vars/all/settings.yml` and copy all this into the file.

```yaml
---
controller_settings:
  settings:
    GALAXY_IGNORE_CERTS: true
...

```

- [settings role](https://github.com/redhat-cop/controller_configuration/blob/devel/roles/settings/README.md)

‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Configure Execution Environments
===

Create a file `group_vars/all/execution_environments.yml` and add the required information to the list `controller_execution_environments` to configure the UI to look like the screenshots
Remember you can use the `ah_host` variable to define the hub. Each image name should look like `{{ ah_host }}/image_name`
```yaml
---
controller_execution_environments:

...

```

‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - Create credential types
===

Create a file `group_vars/all/credential_types.yml` where we will create a list called `controller_credential_types` that has 5 variables per item which are:

- `name` this is required and will be what the credential type will be called
- `description` this is the description of the credential type
- `kind` The type of credential type being added. Note that only cloud and net can be used for creating credential types.
- `inputs` Enter inputs using either JSON or YAML syntax. Refer to the Ansible controller documentation for example syntax. These will be the fields in the GUI that prompt the user for input.
- `injectors` Enter injectors using either JSON or YAML syntax. Refer to the Ansible controller documentation for example syntax. These are the variables that will then be useable in a job.

which the role will loop over and for each item in this list it will create custom credential types for use in the controller.

```yaml
