== ðŸ‘‹ Configuring the Automation controller

In this section, you will only be given a summary of the objects you
need to create along with some screenshots of a controller that is
configured with the completed code. You will also be provided the
variables sections from the readmeâ€™s for each of the required roles to
help you complete this task.

== Task 1 - Configure settings

Create a file `group_vars/all/settings.yml` and copy all this into the
file.

[source,yaml]
----
---
controller_settings:
  settings:
    GALAXY_IGNORE_CERTS: true
...
----

Further documentation for those who are interested to learn more see:

* https://github.com/redhat-cop/controller_configuration/blob/devel/roles/settings/README.md[settings
role]

== Task 2 - Configure Execution Environments

Create a file `group_vars/all/execution_environments.yml` and add the
required information to the list `controller_execution_environments`
to configure the UI to look like the screenshots Remember you can use
the `ah_host` variable to define the hub. Each image name should look
like `{{ ah_host }}/image_name`

controller_execution_environments:

environments role]

== Task 3 - Create credential types

Create a file `group_vars/all/credential_types.yml` where we will
create a list called `controller_credential_types` that has 5
variables per item which are:

* `name` this is required and will be what the credential type will be
called
* `description` this is the description of the credential type
* `kind` The type of credential type being added. Note that only cloud
and net can be used for creating credential types.
* `inputs` Enter inputs using either JSON or YAML syntax. Refer to the
Ansible controller documentation for example syntax. These will be the
fields in the GUI that prompt the user for input.
* `injectors` Enter injectors using either JSON or YAML syntax. Refer
to the Ansible controller documentation for example syntax. These are
the variables that will then be useable in a job.

which the role will loop over and for each item in this list it will
create custom credential types for use in the controller.
