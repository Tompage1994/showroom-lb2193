== üëã Introduction to confinguring private automation hub

#### Estimated time to complete: _45 minutes_

In this section you will configure your private automation hub using the
code provided that is *_missing some critical values/information_* that
you will have to fill in yourself, based on the requirements and looking
at readme‚Äôs for the roles.

This lab uses `+ansible-navigator+` and has been tested against v3.4.1.
It should be pre-installed on your machine.

The screen on the left shows the login screen. You can log in with the
following credentials and then continue on to the tasks:

* Username: `+admin+`
* Password: `+ansible123!+`

A Gitea server is also provided to use with the same password as above,
with the user account `+ansible+`. It is accessable using
`+https://gitea-8443-$INSTRUQT_PARTICIPANT_ID.env.play.instruqt.com/ansible/+`

== ‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Create Collection Repositories and Remotes

Create a file `+group_vars/all/ah_repositories.yml+` to create the list
of community repositories and their remote counterpart.

[source,yaml]
----
---
ah_collection_remotes:
  - name: community-infra
    url: https://galaxy.ansible.com/
    requirements:
      - name: infra.ee_utilities
        version: ">=3.1.0"
      - name: infra.aap_utilities
        version: ">=2.4.0"
      - name: containers.podman
        version: ">=1.13.0"
      - name: awx.awx
        version: ">=24.3.0"

        version: ">=2.7.0"
      - name: infra.eda_configuration
        version: ">=1.0.0"

ah_collection_repositories:
  - name: community-infra-repo
    description: "description of community-infra repository"
    pulp_labels:
      pipeline: "approved"
    distribution:
      state: present
    remote: community-infra

ah_configuration_collection_repository_sync_async_delay: 5

== ‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Create User

Create a file `+group_vars/all/ah_users.yml+` make sure this user has
`+is_superuser+` set to `+true+` and their `+password+` is set to
`+"{{ ah_token_password }}"+`.

[source,yaml]
----
---
ah_token_username: "ah_token_user"
ah_users:
  - username: "{{ ah_token_username }}"
    groups:
      - "admin"
    append: true
    state: "present"
...

config users]

== ‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - Create a group

Create a file `+group_vars/all/ah_groups.yml+` and add `+ah_groups+`
list with one (1) item in it with the `+name+` of `+admin+` and
`+state+` is `+present+`. Do not set permisions. If you need more
information follow the documentation link below. -

config groups]

== ‚òëÔ∏è Task 4 - Create a playbook to configure hub

Create a playbook `+playbooks/hub_config.yml+` add in the `+user+` role
name and the `+collection_remote+` role name in the tasks.

[source,yaml]
----
---
- name: Configure private automation hub after installation
  hosts: execution
  gather_facts: false
  vars_files:
    - "../vault.yml"
  tasks:
    - name: Include group role
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: infra.ah_configuration.group

    - name: Include user role
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: infra.ah_configuration. # Insert Role Name here

    - name: Include collection remote role
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: infra.ah_configuration. # Insert Role Name here

    - name: Include collection repository role
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: infra.ah_configuration.collection_repository

    - name: Include collection repository role
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: infra.ah_configuration.collection_repository_sync
...

== ‚òëÔ∏è Task 5 - Run the playbook

The next step is to run the playbook, for demonstration purposes we are
going to show how to get the Execution Environment(EE) that was built in
the previous step and run the playbook.

Login to the automation hub using the podman login command. This will
ask for a user:pass. After authenticating pull the config_as_code image.

Use the username: *'`admin`'* and the password for your account as
listed at the top of this assignment.

[source,console]
----
podman login --tls-verify=false hub.$INSTRUQT_PARTICIPANT_ID.instruqt.io
----

[source,console]
----
podman pull --tls-verify=false hub.$INSTRUQT_PARTICIPANT_ID.instruqt.io/config_as_code:latest
----

Ansible navigator takes the following commands. The options used are

[cols="^,^",options="header",]
|===
|CLI Option |Use
|`+eei+` |execution environment to use.
|`+i+` |inventory to use.
|`+pa+` |pull arguments to use, in this case ignore tls.
|`+m+` |which mode to use, defaults to interactive.
|===

Use these options to run the playbook in the execution environment.

[source,console]
----
ansible-navigator run playbooks/hub_config.yml --eei hub.$INSTRUQT_PARTICIPANT_ID.instruqt.io/config_as_code -i inventory.yml -l execution --pa='--tls-verify=false' -m stdout  --penv INSTRUQT_PARTICIPANT_ID
----

While the playbook is running you can go to the Automation Hub tab and
peak at the Task Management to see the repositry syncing process

== ‚òëÔ∏è Task 6 - See the Results

Navigate to the Hub Tab, login with the provided passwords * Username:
`+admin+` * Password: `+ansible123!+`

In each section on the left side you should find the changes you have
made Repository: User:
